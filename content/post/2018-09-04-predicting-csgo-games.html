<h1>Context</h1>
<p>As a big fan of CS:GO and analytics, I have built several prediction models to predict outcome of any given CSGO game. Documentation process is meant to remind me in the future of my thought process and techniques that I have used. The dataset is generated by scraping from hltv.org. Just from my understanding, here are the strongest variables that can influence a match outcome:</p>
<ul>
<li>Teams strenght (I am estimating this using ELO Rating (chess system) based on team, line up and individual players) <a href="#elo"><strong>??</strong></a></li>
<li>Form of both teams (Recent resulsts)</li>
<li>Head to head records between 2 teams</li>
<li>Number of games played together for a given lineup</li>
<li>HLTV Rankings</li>
</ul>
<p>For sake of time, will not write about preprocessing steps (very tedious).</p>

<p>You can also embed plots. See Figure <a href="#fig:pie">1</a> for example:</p>
